print("At what size of a project should you start using version managment software? I believe you should immediately start using version management software when starting a project. As you project grows in complexity, you won't have to 'sift' throuh files trying to piece together your project. I assume what you mean by version managment software is an application like github which organizes your project.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know what's required when laying the foundation for a project. Maybe we need to write scripts when preparing a project, in which case, a project management software is probably counterintuitive to efficient production. If that's the case, then it's probably better to utilize a version management softare when you begin outlining the projects UI, or when you begine to develop features.")
